Search for papers from 2024 to 2026 focusing on **AI Agents** or **Multi-Agent Systems** applied to **Protein Representation Learning** and **De novo Protein Design**. I am specifically interested in frameworks where LLM agents call external tools (like AlphaFold, ProteinMPNN, or Rosetta) or collaborate to solve protein engineering tasks.
Find me papers that cover high performance 3d simulations.
Latest research on: AI-generated, LLM-generated, machine-generated code detection.
Did anyone investigate if subnormal numbers are useful for LLM training and inference?
Find me recent papers on hierarchical diffusion language models.
